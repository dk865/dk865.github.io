### Erm... Website.

## Who I Am
I'm dk865, a Developer of all sorts of stuff. I started out with no-code event based game engines, like Construct 3. After 2 Stinking Years of them, I learned Python, a wonderful language. Furthermore, now I'm learning how to make Jailbreak Tweaks, but first comes my repo.
